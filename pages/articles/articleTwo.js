Many organizations offer mentoring programmes for young female professionals, but this does not always mean that they are successful. One of the main reasons is that many young women are not aware of these programmes or simply does not know how to get involved.</p>
                    <p className="mb-6">Historically women have been underrepresented in the workforce, but this is beginning to change. Women are often seen as less capable than their male counterparts. This is due to the fact that they may not have access to the same opportunities and they do not get to learn from their mistakes.</p>
                    <p className="mb-6">Mentoring programs for women have a great impact on the empowerment of women in professional environments. These programs give them an opportunity to learn from their mistakes, and make more informed decisions in the future.</p>
                    <p className="">The importance of women mentoring other women cannot be overstated. Mentoring is an opportunity to share knowledge and skills in order to empower a younger woman with the tools and confidence she needs to succeed.</p>
